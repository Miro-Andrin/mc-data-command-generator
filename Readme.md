# Command draft
This repo is a draft for a proposed addition to [minecraft-data](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data). This project 
aims to take the commands.json report generated by [minecrafts data generator](https://wiki.vg/Data_Generators), and make it easier to parse.


# How to use

I have run this code on Ubuntu/Pop_Os 20.04 with python 3.8 so i cant say how it goes on other os's or python versions. 
I have however definetly used 3.6 features, so make sure you atleast have that version installed.

a) Edit main.py so that the dictionary on the top has all the minecraft versions that you want the commands report for. Remember that data-generators did not exist before minecraft 1.13, so you can't go older then that. Also remeber we are wanting to merge the versons into minecraft-data, so the keys/mc-versions should correspond with the folder names in minecraft-data/data/pc/

b) run main.py and make sure it finishes without any errors. Now the version folders in mc-data have a commands.json, that has been validated agains commands.schema.
